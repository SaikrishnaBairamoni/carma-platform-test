CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcarma_cmake_common.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "carma_cmake_common", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "carma_cmake_common" with any of the following names:

    carma_cmake_commonConfig.cmake
    carma_cmake_common-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "carma_cmake_common" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "carma_cmake_common_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "carma_cmake_common" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
